After a [PhD](https://www.theses.fr/s293917) at the [Institut Pasteur](https://research.pasteur.fr/en/), I am now a PostDoctoral researcher at [Universit√© Claude Bernard - Lyon 1](https://lbbe.univ-lyon1.fr/en/node/108107) working out of Paris. My work focuses on applying machine learning techniques to biological sequence data.

I have written my thesis in an open source fashion. You can read it, of you wish, as an HTML website [here](https://thesis.lucblassel.com) or as a pdf document [here](https://thesis.lucblassel.com/_main.pdf).
