I am a [PhD student](https://www.theses.fr/s293917) at the [Institut Pasteur](https://research.pasteur.fr/en/), working on applying machine learning techniques to biological sequence data.

I am passionate about the intersection between ML and Biology, and for the last four years have been working on my PhD.  
I have written my thesis in an open source fashion. You can read it, of you wish, as an HTML website [here](https://thesis.lucblassel.com) or as a pdf document [here](https://thesis.lucblassel.com/_main.pdf).
